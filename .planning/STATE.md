# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-24)

**Core value:** Learners can step through code execution visually, seeing exactly how algorithms and JavaScript work under the hood
**Current focus:** v1.1 Phase 8 — TwoPointersViz

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.1
Phase: 8 of 10 (TwoPointersViz)
Plan: 1 of 3
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-24 — Completed 08-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [==================░░] 86% (19/22 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 19
- Average duration: ~3.5 min
- Total execution time: ~66 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2 | ~4 min | ~2 min |
| 02-loopsviz | 2 | ~7 min | ~3.5 min |
| 03-variablesviz | 3 | ~12 min | ~4 min |
| 04-functionsviz | 3 | ~11 min | ~3.7 min |
| 05-arraysbasicsviz | 3 | ~11 min | ~3.7 min |
| 06-objectsbasicsviz | 3 | ~12 min | ~4 min |
| 07-foundation | 2 | ~5 min | ~2.5 min |
| 08-twopointerviz | 1 | ~4 min | ~4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 06-03 (~4m), 07-01 (~2m), 07-02 (~3m), 08-01 (~4m)
- Trend: Consistent, DSA viz plans similar to v1.0 viz plans

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Decision | Choice | Plan |
|----------|--------|------|
| DSA pattern page routing | /concepts/dsa/patterns/[patternId] | v1.1 research |
| Pattern viz architecture | DSAPatterns/ directory with self-contained components | v1.1 research |
| Decision visualization | Show condition before movement, not just result | v1.1 research |
| DSAPattern type separate from Concept | Tailored for patterns with variants and complexity | 07-01 |
| Step data in components not data file | Matches v1.0 pattern, keeps viz self-contained | 07-01 |
| Pattern page structure mirrors JS concepts | Server component for SEO, client for rendering | 07-02 |
| TwoPointersViz step data in component | Follows v1.0 pattern, keeps viz self-contained | 08-01 |
